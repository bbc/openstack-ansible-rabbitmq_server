    This release addresses an issue when upgrading from Ubuntu Bionic to
    Ubuntu Focal during the Victoria release cycle. By default the same
    RabbitMQ version will now be installed for both Bionic and Focal to avoid
    a downgrade from being attempted. It is strongly recommended to upgrade
    to this release before attempting an upgrade to Ubuntu Focal.
